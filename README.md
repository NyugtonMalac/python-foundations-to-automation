# Python Foundations to Automation

This repository contains my hands-on Python practice and portfolio work, created while deepening my Python skills from core language foundations to data analysis, automation, and cloud-based deployment.

The focus of this repository is not on isolated code snippets, but on building practical, structured solutions that reflect real-world data handling, automation, and analytical use cases.

## Covered Topics
- Python fundamentals and clean coding principles
- Object-oriented programming
- Concurrency and asynchronous execution
- Testing, debugging, and code quality
- Data extraction (APIs, ETL processes)
- Data analysis with Pandas and SQL integration
- Database interaction using Python
- Data visualization and Streamlit applications
- Automation and scripting (files, scheduling, web scraping)
- Basic API development with FastAPI
- Serverless deployment using Azure Functions

## Structure
The repository is organized by topic areas to reflect a practical learning and application path rather than a course timeline.

## Disclaimer
The code examples are created for learning and portfolio purposes using practice datasets and simulated use cases designed to reflect real-world data structures.
